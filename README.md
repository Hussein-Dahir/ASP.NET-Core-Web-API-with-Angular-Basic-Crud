# ASP.NET Core Web API with Angular Basic CRUD (Create-Read-Update-Delete) Operations 

## Overview
This sample ASP.NET Core Web API (v3.1) and Angular (v9) with Typescript projects demonstrate a basic implementation of CRUD (Create-Read-Update-Delete) Operations. 

The [webapi](https://github.com/deanilvincent/ASP.NET-Core-Web-API-with-Angular-Basic-Crud/tree/master/webapi) serves as the backend web api or the RESTful Service that handles different requests like `get`,`post`,`put` & `delete` methods. While the project [angular](https://github.com/deanilvincent/ASP.NET-Core-Web-API-with-Angular-Basic-Crud/tree/master/angular) serves as the frontend that consumes the requests from our web api project. 

Additionally, I added a `signalr` feature in this project. So, every time there's a new changes or update made by the server, it will automatically trigger the angular list of data and refresh it. To learn more about `SignalR` visit this [link](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/aspnet/signalr)

## Setup
After you download/clone this project, you need to restore the packages on each project.

### For Angular Project
Navigate to the `angular` folder path and do the following:
**To restore**
```
npm i // to restore the packages
```
**To run the app:**
```
ng start
```
**To build for production:**
```
ng build
```
**To run test:**
```
ng test
```
### For ASP.NET Core Web API Project
Navigate to the `webapi` folder path and do the following:
**To restore**
```
dotnet restore
```
**To build and check some errors (if there's any)**
```
dotnet build
```
**To run the app**
```
dotnet run
```
### Connect to database
Another thing, make sure to change the connection string in the `Startup.cs` class of the project `webapi`. If you have no database yet, do the migration. 

Update the database:
```
dotnet ef database update
```
